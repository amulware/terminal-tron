# Terminal Tron

This is a little Tron ~~clone~~ inspired game. The game runs entirely in the terminal.

I started this during a power outage because [@dasilvacontin](https://github.com/dasilvacontin) told me to.

The [first commit](https://github.com/amulware/terminal-tron/tree/f807e06fc3621f5e908f60a34d4c9451d8c7004d) is how far I got before my laptop shut itself down.
It includes a basic framework, simple tilemap and controllable bike.
